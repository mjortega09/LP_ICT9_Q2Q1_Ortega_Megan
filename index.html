	<p style="text-align:center; color: white;"> What is a cryptocurrency? A cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment. The use of encryption technologies means that cryptocurrencies function both as a currency and as a virtual accounting system. To use cryptocurrencies, you’ll need a cryptocurrency wallet.
